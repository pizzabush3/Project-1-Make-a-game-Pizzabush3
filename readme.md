# Dumb ways to live

## Descriptions
Choose your own adventure game where you are stuck in a loop, there will be many different endings, but only 1 good ending
There will be a dog named loopy doopy who saves you whenever you do something dangerous attempting to escape the loop, for example a good ending would be convincing loopy doopy that going on and on over and over again is not the way, while a bad ending might be locking away loopy doopy so that he can't repeat the code


## Flow chart

Sketch a flow chart of your game. What are the options the user can choose between, and where will those choices lead them? You might want to draw this on paper, take a picture, and upload that here.
